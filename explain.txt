- Sun Tzu is a famous Chinese general who became popular after writing his book, “The Art of War.”

- born around 544 BC and died around 496 BC

- This book talked about revolutionary military strategies that are still used today

- They often link to modern day business strategies (13 chapters/principles)

- Contains funny/ wise quotes that have been used in pop culture/ movies/technoblade

- Ex."If you know the enemy and know yourself, you need not fear the result of a hundred battles"
 and "The supreme art of war is to subdue the enemy without fighting."

- Bot purpose: Be like Sun Tzu and give guidance

- How it works:
     - quote(ID, Category, MainIdea, BusinessUse, Context, 'Advice', 'Quote text.').
     - Grabs semantics from the quotes, categories, or main idea to understand the problem
     - gives concise straightforward advice based on Sun Tzu's strategic thinking
     - applies knowledge on modern topics like Buisness, Law, or Tech

- Different than other SunTzu GPT bots: sticks to topic and doesn’t have ChatGPT unrelated fluff

- Main issues I overcame: GitHub, OpenAI api key, replacing restaurant bot logic

- Potential Future Improvements:
     - Diaplay on a Website w Flask, HTML, CSS, 
     - Add more predicates to the knowledge base
     - Clean up code
